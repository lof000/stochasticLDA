a two dimensional misfit metallic compound, is famous for its rich phases accessed by temperature, i.e. high temperature spin-state transition, metal-insulator transition (MIT) at intermediate temperature (âˆ¼ 100 K) and low temperature spin density wave (SDW). It enters into short range SDW phase below TMIT and long range SDW completes at 27 K [Phys. Rev. B 67, 104410 (2003)]. Information on independent role of misfit layers (rocksalt/Ca2CoO3 \& triangular/CoO2) in these phases is scarce. By combining a set of complementary macroscopic (DC magnetization and resistivity) and microscopic (neutron diffraction and X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy) measurements on pure (CCO) and Tb substituted in the rocksalt layer of CCO (CCO1), magnetic correlations in both subsystems of this misfit compound are unraveled. CCO is found to exhibit glassiness, as well as exchange bias (EB) effects, while CCO1 does not exhibit glassiness, albeit it shows weaker EB effect. Our results show that the magneto-crystalline anisotropy associated with the rocksalt layer acts as a source of pinning, which is responsible for EB effect as well as for localization of spins in triangular (CoO2) layer, giving rise to glassiness in CCO. By combining local structure investigations from extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy and neutron diffraction results on CCO, we also confirm that the SDW arises in the CoO2 layer
